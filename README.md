# Django_blog
This is a blog application made using django python framework. It is aimed at learning CRUD operations within django and use of class based views to implement functionality with fewer lines of code
I've used django documentation as a reference to the best way to architect the application following best practices and ensuring that all the features are well implemented and documented.
## Features
- Admin site
- User registration and login
- User profiles
- Create, Read, Update and delete blog posts with images and text
- User management and password reset
- Filter blog posts by authors
- Search for blog posts by specific users
- pagination
- UI design with bootstrap
